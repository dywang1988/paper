gbdt+emb sim features

Realtime p13n

Adapting training
1. negative sampling within a certain market

Leveraging conversions as global context
1. importance of click sessions that end up in conversions
2. treat booked list as global context that is always predicted as the window moves over the session

User type embedding
1. capture long-term interest
2. target signal is sparse, no enough data, train embedding at a level of user type

Rejection as explicit negatives

List embedding
1. Booked Listing as global context: adapt the optimization such that at each step we predict not only the neighboring clicked listings but the eventually booked listing .
2. Adapting training
3. Coldstart list embedding: use meta-data about the list to find 3 geographically closest listings.

User-type & list-type embedding
1. List embedding trained using click sessions, suitable for short-term, in-session, personalization, within a certain market
2. Cross-market similarity would be learn from sessions constructed of listings that a particular user booked over time.
3. Learning user-type embedding in the same vector space as list-type embedding.

Learning embedding tricks
1. 800 millions click session (30 minutes inactivity rules)
2. remove accident and short clicks (stay for less than 30 seconds)
3. keep only sessions consisting of 2 or more clicks
4. oversample booked sessions by 5x in the training data

Ranking use embeddings
1. formulate problem as pairwise regression with LambaRank
2. use as cross-features: ClkSim, SkipSim, LongClkSim, UserTypeListTypeSim...
3. partial dependency plot
